## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Microsoft Sentinel workspace
- Entra ID logs flowing into Sentinel
- Log Analytics Reader permissions (minimum)

**Data Connectors to Enable:**
1. Azure Active Directory (Entra ID)
2. Azure AD Identity Protection
3. Office 365 (optional - for enhanced context)

### Verification

Check that data is flowing:
```kql
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| take 10
```

## 💻 Usage Guide

### Running Queries in Microsoft Sentinel

1. Navigate to Azure Portal → Microsoft Sentinel
2. Select your workspace
3. Go to **Logs** in the left menu
4. Copy a query from the `kql-queries/` folder
5. Paste into the query window
6. Adjust time ranges as needed
7. Click **Run**

### Creating Analytics Rules

Transform hunting queries into automated detections:

1. Go to **Analytics** in Sentinel
2. Click **+ Create** → **Scheduled query rule**
3. Configure:
   - **Name:** Descriptive rule name
   - **Severity:** Based on threat level
   - **MITRE ATT&CK:** Map to techniques
   - **Query:** Paste from collection
   - **Frequency:** How often to run
   - **Threshold:** Alert conditions
4. Configure incident settings
5. Enable automated responses (optional)
6. Review and create

### Customization Examples

**Adjust time ranges:**
```kql
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)  // Last 24 hours
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)   // Last 7 days
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)  // Last 30 days
```

**Modify thresholds:**
```kql
| where FailedAttempts > 5    // Original
| where FailedAttempts > 10   // More tolerant
| where FailedAttempts > 3    // More sensitive
```

**Filter for specific users:**
```kql
| where UserPrincipalName == "admin@contoso.com"
| where UserPrincipalName contains "admin"
| where UserPrincipalName endswith "@contoso.com"
```

## 📊 Query Development Workflow

```
1. Hunt → Test queries manually to find threats
2. Tune → Adjust thresholds based on your environment
3. Validate → Confirm true/false positive rates
4. Automate → Convert to scheduled analytics rules
5. Respond → Add automated response playbooks
6. Review → Monitor effectiveness and adjust
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Before Deployment

✅ **Baseline Your Environment**
- Run queries over 30-90 days
- Understand normal patterns
- Document expected behaviors

✅ **Start Conservative**
- Use higher thresholds initially
- Gradually tighten as you tune
- Monitor false positive rates

✅ **Test in Stages**
- Test in non-production first
- Start with hunting queries
- Convert to rules after validation

### During Operations

✅ **Regular Reviews**
- Weekly: Review high-severity alerts
- Monthly: Tune detection rules
- Quarterly: Update queries for new threats

✅ **Document Exceptions**
- Known service accounts
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Business-justified anomalies

✅ **Performance Monitoring**
- Track query execution times
- Optimize slow queries
- Use shorter time windows where possible

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization Tips

```kql
// ❌ BAD - Filters late
SigninLogs
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where UserPrincipalName contains "admin"

// ✅ GOOD - Filters early
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where UserPrincipalName contains "admin"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
```

### Best Practices

1. **Filter early** - Use `where` clauses as soon as possible
2. **Limit columns** - Use `project` to select only needed fields
3. **Aggregate wisely** - Use `summarize` to reduce data volume
4. **Time scope** - Start with shorter time ranges for testing
5. **Avoid wildcards** - Use specific strings when possible

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data Handling

- Queries don't extract credentials or secrets
- Be careful when sharing query results
- Redact sensitive information in screenshots
- Follow your organization's data handling policies

### Role-Based Access

Recommended permissions:
- **Security Analysts:** Log Analytics Reader
- **Security Engineers:** Log Analytics Contributor
- **SOC Managers:** Sentinel Contributor
